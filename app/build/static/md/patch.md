`Patches` reports the agentset of all patches in a model, while `patch` reports a specific patch. They are commonly used to command the patches to do something in an `ask patches [ ... ]` context. To report a specific patch, use `patch x y`, for example `ask patch 2 -3 [set pcolor green]` would set the patch with an x-coordinate of 2 and a y-coordinate of -3 to green, while `ask patches [ set pcolor green ]` would change all of the patches in the model to green.
