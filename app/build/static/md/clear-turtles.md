*Clear-patches* is a command that clears the patches by resetting all patch variables to their default initial values, including setting their color to black. It is usually located in a command procedure. The shorthand version of this command is *cp*. 

*Clear-turtles* is a command that removes all the turtles as well as resets the numbering of turtles. It is usually located in a command procedure. The shorthand version of this command is *ct*. See [die](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#die) for more about removing turtles from a plot. 

These are only used when we do not want to use *clear-all*. For example, if we wanna clear the patches but keep some global variablesâ€™ values & the position of the turtles, you would use *clear-patches*. If we wanna clear the turtles but keep the patches and their initial values, you would use *clear-turtles*.
