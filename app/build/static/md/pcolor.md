`pcolor` is a built-in patch variable that holds the color of the patch. In other words, this primitive changes the background color. Because `pcolor` is a variable, you need to use the `set` command to change it. You can change the patch color in the command center on the Interface tab or using the Inspector. Be sure to change the drop-down to “patches” before typing in the command! `pcolor` can be represented by simply stating the color (e.g., brown, yellow, red; note that there are no quotation marks around the color names) or NetLogo color (a single number). For example, you can write `ask patches [set pcolor pink]` or `ask patches [ set pcolor 15]`. Turtles can directly access and change the color of the patch they are on using this primitive. For example: `ask turtles [ set pcolor yellow]`.   To change the color of the turtles, see [*color*](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#color) .
