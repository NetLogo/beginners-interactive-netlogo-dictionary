`Member?` can be used with **lists** or **agentsets**, but is more commonly used with lists. `Member?` reports **True** if the given value or agent appears in the given list or agentset, and takes the form `member? value list` or `member? agent agentset`. For example, `show member? 5 [ 3 4 5 6 ]` would report **True**, and `show member? 5 [1 3 2 ]` would report **False**; `show member? turtle 0 turtle` would report **True**, while `show member? patch 0 turtles` would report **False**.
