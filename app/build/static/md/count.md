`Count` returns the number of agents in a specified agentset, where **agentset** can be **turtles**, **patches**, **links**, etc. (See `with` to narrow down a given agentset.) For example, `show count turtles` would show the total number of turtles in a model, and  `show count turtles with [color = green]` would show the number of green turtles in the model.
