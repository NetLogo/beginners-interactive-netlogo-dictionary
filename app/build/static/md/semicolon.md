The `semicolon` is used for making helpful comments or notes on a line of code. All the characters will turn grey after a semicolon is used. Keep in mind that whenever a semicolon is used at the beginning of the line, this part of the code will not run. More than one semicolon can be used for emphasis. For example: 
```
;; this procedure moves the fish forward
 to move-fish 
 ask fish [ fd 1 ]  
end
```
