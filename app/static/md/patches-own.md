### **patches-own** [ *variable1* *variable2* ... ]
`Patches-own` defines variables that belong exclusively to the patches of a model. (See its counterpart `turtles-own` for defining turtlesâ€™ variables.) The variables are usually a trait or characteristic of the patches; for example if your patches are representing soil in your model, you might use `patches-own [ nutrients ] `. It can include multiple variables as long as they are within the enclosing `[]`. Like global variables and other agent variables, it must be defined at the top of your code, before any procedure definitions. Patch variables can also be accessed by a turtle that is standing on that patch.
