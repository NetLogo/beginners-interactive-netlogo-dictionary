`create-turtles` is a function that creates turtles with random colors and headings in the default shape of a triangle. `Crt` is the shorthand version of create-turtles. The syntax of this function is `create-turtles *insert number here*`.  By using brackets [   ] you can optionally pass commands to those turtles. For example, you can write `create-turtles 100 [ set shape “person” forward 10 ]` which creates 100 turtles in the shape of a person and moves them forward 10 times. Only the observer can use this command!  For patches creating turtles, see [*sprout*](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#sprout). For turtles creating new turtles, see [*hatch*](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#hatch).
