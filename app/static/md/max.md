`max` reports the maximum value in a given list. It takes the form of `max list`. For example, `show max [1 2 3]` will return 3. `max` is commonly used on a specific variable of an agentset, which would look like `max [variable] of agentset`. So `ask turtles with max [size] of turtles [ set color white ]` would set the largest turtle or turtles to white.
