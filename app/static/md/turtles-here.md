`Turtles-here` returns the **agentset** of all the turtles on the callerâ€™s patch, including itself if the caller is a turtle. For example, 

```
create-turtles 3 
ask turtles [ show count turtles-here ]
```
would report `3`. You can also specify a breed by using `<breed>-here`; if there were some cats and mice in a model together, `ask cats [ if any? mice-here [ chase ]  ]` would make a cat chase the mice if they are on the same patch.



In the  model below, there are some frogs moving around in a pond. If a frog hops onto a lilypad (green patch), its weight will push the lilypad into the water, turning it blue. We use `turtles-here` to check if there is a frog on top of a lilypad.
