`turtles` reports the agentset of all turtles in a model, while `turtle` reports a specific turtle. They are commonly used to command the turtles to do something in an `ask turtles [ ... ]` context. To report a specific turtle, use `turtle x`, for example `ask turtle 2 [ set color green ]` would set the turtle number 2 to green, while `ask turtles [ set color green ]` would change all of the turtles in the model to green.
