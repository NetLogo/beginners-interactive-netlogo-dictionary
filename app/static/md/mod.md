## *number1* **mod** *number2*
The primitive `mod` completes the **modulo operation**, which takes two numbers, divides them, and returns the remainder, where the remainder of `(number1 / number2)` is the value reported. For example, `show 17 mod 4` would report 1, because 17 divided by 4 has a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 1. `Show 9 mod 3` would report 0, because 9 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 0.
