`Clear-turtles` is a primitive that removes all the turtles from a model.  The shorthand version of this command is *ct*. See [die](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#die) to remove specific turtles from a model.



`clear-turtles` is only used when we do not want to use *clear-all*. For example, if we want to clear the turtles but keep the patches and their initial values, you would use *clear-turtles*.
