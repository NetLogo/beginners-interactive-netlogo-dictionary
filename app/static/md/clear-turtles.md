`Clear-turtles` is a primitive that removes all the turtles from the model at once. The shorthand version of this primitive is `ct`. 



`clear-turtles` is only used when we do not want to use *clear-all*. For example, if you wanted to remove the turtles but keep the patches the same and preserve the values of the global variables, you would use `clear-turtles`.

FIX THE MODEL

In the model example below, we have two buttons. The first one makes patches' color green and creates some cows on random positions. The second button simply runs the `clear-patches` primitive to clear the patches but leave the cows the same.
