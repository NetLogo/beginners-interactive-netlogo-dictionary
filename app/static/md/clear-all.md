`clear-all` essentially clears *all* the drawings, turtles, plots, etc., leaving a blank slate. A shorthand version of `clear-all` is `ca` . `clear-all` is usually located at the beginning of a modelâ€™s setup procedure, to make sure the model starts out with nothing already there. To remove turtles from the model, see [*clear-turtles*](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#clear-turtles). To remove patches from the model, see [*clear-patches*](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#clear-patches).
