`Floor` is a rounding primitive that reports the closest integer below the number, rounding down. For example, `show floor 4.8` would return 4, and `show floor -7.5` would return -8. 



`Ceiling` is another rounding primitive that reports the closest integer above the number, rounding up. For example, `show ceiling 5.3` would return 6, and `show ceiling -4.4` would return -4.
