`Hatch` is used to create new turtles by an existing turtle. It has the form of `hatch number-of-new-turtles [ commands ]`. 

The new turtles inherit all the same characteristics as the parent turtle (for example size, color, location, etc.). After being created, the new turtles will run the commands independently. (Note: adding commands are optional, and used if you want to change a variable from the parent or have the new turtle do something specific.) 

`Hatch` is a primitive that can only be used by turtles, that is, within an `ask turtles [ â€¦ ] `; only turtles can hatch turtles. To create turtles from patches, see `sprout`.
