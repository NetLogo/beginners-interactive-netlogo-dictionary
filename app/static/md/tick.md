A **tick** is a measure of time in NetLogo models (like seconds or minutes). Ticks are used instead of these real world measures of time, because ticks are standardized across all models and computers; some models and computers run slower than others, but ticks are always the same! 

When creating a model, you have the option of choosing *continuous* or *tick-based* updates. This changes how often the view updates; *continuous* displays every change as it happens, and *tick-based* updates the entire model after one tick. Most models in the Models Library use *tick-based* updates. If your model is using *tick-based* updates, it must include `tick`, usually placed at the end of the `go` procedure. The primitive `tick` advances the **tick counter** by one, and updates the plots and monitors of a model. If you are using *tick-based* updates and include `tick` in your code, you must remember to reset the ticks before running the model by adding `reset-ticks` into the setup procedure, or else an error will occur. See `reset-ticks` for more. 



In the model below, we use `ticks` to determine if the patches' pcolor is green or black, representing day or night. Every 12 ticks, it switches from day to night, or vice versa.
