### **towards** *agent*
Towards is a reporter that returns the angle that would be the heading of the caller if it was to face another specified  agent. For example, if **turtle 0** is at the center of the model, and **turtle 1** is directly to the right of it, `ask turtle 0 [ show towards turtle 1 ]` would print `90`. `Towards` reports the absolute angle between the coordinates of the two agents, and will change as the agents move around, but will not change if the headings of the agents change.
