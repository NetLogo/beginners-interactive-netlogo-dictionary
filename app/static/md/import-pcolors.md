`Import-pcolors ` is a primitive that allows the user to import an image in NetLogo. As a result,the patch colors are changed and turtles are able to interact with this primitive. The syntax of this primitive is `import-pcolors "insert filename here‚Äù`. The image is scaled to the same dimensions as the patch grid while maintaining the original aspect ratio of the image. The resulting patch colors may be distorted, since the NetLogo color swatches does not include all possible colors. To simply display a backdrop without the color distortion, see import-drawing. The following image file formats are supported: JPG, GIF, and PNG. **Note**: This primitive is not compatible with NetLogo Web.
