### **sprout** *number-of-turtles* [ commands ]
### **sprout-<breed>** *number-of-breed* [ commands ]
`Sprout` creates new turtles from the current patch, and must be used within an `ask patches [...]` context.  Unless specified in the commands, the new turtles will have random headings and colors. After being created, the turtles run the commands one at a time, in a random order. `Sprout-<breed>` can also be used to create turtles of a specific breed. For creating new turtles from existing turtles, see `hatch`.
