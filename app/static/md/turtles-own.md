### **turtles-own** [ *variable1* *variable2* ... ]
##### **<breed>-own** [ *variable1* *variable2* ... ]
`Turtles-own` defines variables that belong to all turtles in a model. The variables are usually a trait or aspect specific to the turtle, like *is-hungry?* or *energy*. Like global variables and other agent variables, it must be defined at the top of your code, before any procedure definitions. You can define one variable or multiple, but they must all be within the brackets. 

If you have defined multiple breeds of turtles, `turtles-own` will apply the variable to all breeds. However, you can define a variable for a specific breed by using `<breed>-own`, where **<breed>** is the name of your breed. For example, if you have already defined a breed of turtles by `breed [birds bird]`, you can create a variable for only birds by using `birds-own [wing-size]`.
