`Face` sets a turtleâ€™s heading to point towards another specific agent. `Face` is usually used to point a turtle towards another turtle or a specific patch. For example, if two turtles are on opposite edges of a model, `ask one-of turtles [ face other-turtle ]` will turn the turtle to face the other turtle. `ask turtles [ face patch 0 0 ]` will turn all turtles to face the center of the model.
