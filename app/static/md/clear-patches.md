`Clear-patches` is a primitive that clears all the patches. It resets all patch variables to their default initial values, including setting their color to black. The shorthand version of this primitive is *cp*. (See `clear-turtles` for clearing all turtles from a model.)



`clear-patches` is only used when we do not want to use *clear-all*. For example, if we want to clear the patches but keep some global variablesâ€™ values & the position of the turtles, you would use *clear-patches*.
