`Clear-patches` is a primitive that clears all the patches. It resets all patch variables to their default initial values and sets their color to black. The shorthand version of this primitive is `cp`. 



`clear-patches` is only used when we do not want to use *clear-all*. For example, if you wanted to clear the patches but keep some global variablesâ€™ values and the keep the existing turtles the same, you would use *clear-patches*. This may come 



In the model example below, we have two buttons. The first one makes patches' color green and creates some cows on random positions. The second button simply runs the `clear-patches` primitive to clear the patches but leave the cows the same.
