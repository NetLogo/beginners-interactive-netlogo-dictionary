`color` is a built-in turtle characteristic that represents the color of the turtle. `color` is a reporter, and can be used to access the color of the turtle. You can also use the `set` command to change the color of the turtle or you can change the color in the command center on the Interface tab.  Be sure to change the drop-down to “turtles” before typing in the command! For example



 ```ask turtles [ set color brown ]``` 



will set the initial color of the turtles brown. In the model below, there are some eagles, white rats, and gray rats. The eagles are hunting the rats, but can see the white rats much better than the gray. So if an eagle is on the same patch as a white rat (but not a gray one) it will eat it.
