`color` is a built-in turtle characteristic that represents the color of the turtle. `color` is a reporter, and can be used to access the color of the turtle. You can also use the `set` command to change the color of the turtle or you can change the color in the command center on the Interface tab.  Be sure to change the drop-down to “turtles” before typing in the command! For example



 ```ask turtles [ set color brown ]``` 



will set the initial color of the turtles brown.
