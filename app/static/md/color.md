`color` is a built-in turtle characteristic that changes the color of the turtle. You can use the `set` command to change the color of the turtle or you can change the color in the command center on the Interface tab. Be sure to change the drop-down to “turtles” before typing in the command! For example: `ask turtles [ set color brown ]`. This will set the initial color of the turtles brown.
