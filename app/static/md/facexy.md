`facexy` is a command for turtles that sets the turtleâ€™s heading towards the point (x,y). Its syntax is:



```facexy [x-cor y-cor]``` 



`facexy` doesn't change a turtle's position, only its heading. For example, to make turtle 1 face towards the point (2,3), we would say:



``` ask turtle 1 [ facexy 2 3 ] ```



**Note:** if the turtle is already on the point (x, y),  the turtle's heading won't change.
