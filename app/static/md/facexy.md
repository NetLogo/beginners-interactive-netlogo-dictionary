`facexy` is a command for turtles that sets the turtleâ€™s heading towards the point (x,y). The syntax of this command is `facexy [number number]`.  For example: 
```ask turtle 1 [facexy 2 3]```
 This asks turtle 1 to face towards the point 2,3.
 **Note**: that if the turtle is on the point (x,y), then the turtle's heading won't change.
