`facexy` is a command for turtles that sets the turtleâ€™s heading towards the point (x,y). Its syntax  is

```facexy [x-cor y-cor]``` 

For example, 

``` ask turtle 1 [ facexy 2 3 ] ```

asks turtle 1 to face towards the point (2,3). **Note:** if the turtle is already on the point (x, y),  the turtle's heading won't change.
