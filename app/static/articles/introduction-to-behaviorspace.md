# Running computational experiments with BehaviorSpace

&nbsp;

`We will have a an extended article here soon. Maybe even a video. The following text is just a placeholder copied from the old docs. Stay tuned.`

BehaviorSpace is a software tool integrated with NetLogo that allows you to perform experiments with models.

BehaviorSpace runs a model many times, systematically varying the model’s settings and recording the results of each model run. This process is sometimes called “parameter sweeping”. It lets you explore the model’s “space” of possible behaviors and determine which combinations of settings cause the behaviors of interest.

If your computer has multiple processor cores, then by default, model runs will happen in parallel, one per core.
