# Turtles in NetLogo

&nbsp;

<p class="badge badge-warning">Note to the devs: this page needs to be finished.</p>

In NetLogo, there are four types of agents: **turtles**, **patches**, **links**, and the **observer**.

Turtles are agents that move around in the world. The world is two dimensional and is divided up into a grid of patches. Each patch is a square piece of “ground” over which turtles can move. Links are agents that connect two turtles. The observer doesn’t have a location – you can imagine it as looking out over the world of turtles and patches.
