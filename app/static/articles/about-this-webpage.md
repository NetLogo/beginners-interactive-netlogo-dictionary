# About Beginner's Interactive NetLogo Dictionary

&nbsp;

We created the Beginner's Interactive NetLogo Dictionary (BIND) to provide an extensive but approacheable starting point for new learners of NetLogo. By *new learner*, we do not only mean students; we mean a wide spectrum of newcomers ranging from K-12 and college students who learn NetLogo as part of their in-school curriculum or after school programs to teachers who would like to create novel computational models for their students to scientists who would like to learn NetLogo to construct models of cutting-edge scientific phenomena. Thus, each item in this dictionary includes a beginner friendly description and an interactive code example so that you can see each NetLogo primitive in action and tinker with ideas.
